bio: I love science and I love data! After finishing a PhD in genetic engineering, I continued my quest for discovering new patterns through data science and machine learning. I worked for 3 years as a Data/ML Engineer and I am currently DevRel at Microsoft. Someday, I wish to leverage artificial intelligence and genetics to improve people's lives.
