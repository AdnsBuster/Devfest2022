abstract: "Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!"
