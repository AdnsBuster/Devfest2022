  This talk will discuss tracing in Go, with discussions around how this works in different languages and some practical applications of tracing. This will be more technically focused, and won't be a product demo for Datadog (though there will likely be mentions of how tracing works at Datadog)
  - Practical applications of tracing
  - How the tracing libraries instrument Go code in Datadog APM 
  - Benefits and limitations of tracing in different languages (e.g. compiled versus interpreted languages)
  - Open Telemetry API for tracing
